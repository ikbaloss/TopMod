# TopMod
This Python application performs topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) from the Gensim library.

Before performing topic modeling, the application allows users to:
- Preprocess and clean the input text, and
- Specify the number of topics to be generated.

After the modeling is completed, users can:
- Explore the content of documents associated with each topic to assess whether a topic is too broad, too fragmented, or potentially suitable for merging with another topic.
